# dangerous-paths-coding-challenge
A unique coding challenge written in vanilla ES5 JS. See if you can solve all of the game scenarios, focus on clean, readable code.

## Getting Started

Checkout master and then switch to a branch so you can submit your own solution.

Open <i>index.html</i> in a browser and press <i>view</i> next to <i>Scenario 1</i> to see the first challenge. Use the arrow keys to manually navigate your player (blue) to the end (green). Don't step off the path.

Open <i>solutions.js</i> and add code to <i>runSolution()</i> to solve the scenario programatically by moving the player and checking the cells around you. To test your solution press the <i>run</i> button to see if it works. Once you have solved it, press <i>Run All and Progress</i>, this will run your scenario and if it passes unlock the next one.

Work your way through the scenarios but remember, to progress ALL scenarios must pass.
