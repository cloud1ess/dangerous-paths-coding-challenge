# dangerous-paths-coding-challenge
A unique coding challenge written in vanilla ES5 JS. See if you can solve all of the game scenarios, focus on clean, readable code.

#Â Getting Started

Checkout master and then switch to a branch so you can submit your own solution.

Open -index.html- in a browser and press -view- next to -Scenario 1- to see the first challenge. Use the arrow keys to manually navigate your player (blue) to the end (green). Don't step off the path.

Open -solutions.js- and add code to -runSolution()- to solve the scenario programatically by moving the player and checking the cells around you. To test your solution press the -run- button to see if it works. Once you have solved it, press -Run All and Progress-, this will run your scenario and if it passes unlock the next one.

Work your way through the scenarios but remember, to progress ALL scenarios must pass.
